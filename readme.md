## FAQ  
- **I've got another mod that changes boat behavior, is this compatible?**  
  - Ashore has only been tested with a few other boat related mods. Of those tested, all have been compatible. That being said, there may be incompatibilities we don't know of.  
- **How does block slipperiness affect this mod?**  
  - Ashore uses the higher value of `0.9F` or `landFriction`. This should result in the same speed as vanilla for slippery vanilla blocks (e.g Blue Ice).  
- **Can I use this in a modpack or video?**  
  - Yes, you can use this mod in modpacks or videos.  
- **Will you port this mod to 1.x.x?**  
  - I am unlikely to port to specific versions, as this mod was made for fun. However, other developers are free to port this mod, as long as they adhere to the conditions of the LGPL-3.0-or-later license.  
  
## Known Compatible Mods  
**These mods have been tested using Ashore `1.0.0`, Quilt Loader `0.21.1-beta.2`, and Minecraft `1.20.2`.**
