# Ashore (Fabric/Quilt)

**WARNING:** You may experience issues when running with some other boat mods.  

## About  
Ashore is a Minecraft mod developed for the Fabric/Quilt Loader. This mod switches boat velocity, making them slower on water and faster on land.

### Slipperiness  
When on land, the boat will use the higher value `0.9F` or `nearbySlipperiness`.  
With vanilla blocks - such as Blue Ice - this should result in the same velocity as without the mod.   

## Mod Requirements  
You only need the Fabric or Quilt Loader.
